cypher
======

The simple key-value storage for private data. Uses AES algoritm to encrypt storage file. The key benefit of this storage - is that you don't need to decrypt the whole file and temporary store it on your computer.

Implemented command set:
	put KEY VALUE - puts key value into encrypted storage
	get RE - dump all saved keys, matching perl regexp RE with it's values
	search MASK - shows you all KEYS that satisfy specified MASK

use ./cypher --help to get detailed info

Dependencies for Ubuntu:
	libcrypt-rijndael-perl
	libterm-readline-gnu-perl
	libswitch-perl
